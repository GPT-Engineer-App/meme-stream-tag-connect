# meme-stream-tag-connect

Create a web application called MemeStream, which is a social media platform that allows users to upload, vote on, and comment on image memes.  When uploading a new meme image, users should be able to add #tags to it.  When memes are displayed in the front end feed, those tags should link to a tag feed.
